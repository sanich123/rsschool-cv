### I am a real humanitarian. By basic education - a pianist, graduated from the conservatory. But let's not talk about sad things. I started learning front-end development about a year ago. I really like ReactJS, Redux, but not so much native JavaScript. Especially OOP :) Recently started diving into preprocessors, Gulp and responsive layout. Very interesting, but still not clear :)

### Skills: HTML(PUG), CSS(Less), JS(React), Redux, БЭМ, Git/NPM, Gulp/Webpack/CRA, Rest API, HTTP

### Example of code:
```
var makeFancyString = function(s) {
    let result = '';
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) {
            count++;
            if (count <= 2) {
                result += s[i];
            }
        } else {
            count = 1;
            result += s[i];
        }
    } 

    return result;
};
```
